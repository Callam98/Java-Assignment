The project that i chose to do was "Machine Leaening Using Naive Bayes
First i created a gui using java swing to allow a user to selecrt their symptoms
My Project Contains 6 Classes "Control ,Gui ,AdminMenu ,File Processor ,Login and Patient"
Youll first be brought to a log in menu where you can enter Crdentials to go to the Admin Page or continue as a patient to check your symptoms,
slect your syptoms from the menu of radio buttons and press the "Check" button to display the probability that you have tonsilitis.
If you go to the admin menu after logging in you will be presented wit a large text pane and three buttns at the bottom. Click display Data and gthe contents of the csv file will appear in the pane
If you click the accurayc button it will call the accuracy function from within the file processor it will then get the data to test itslef and see how accurate it it , it does this by selecting 70% of the data and using that for testing.
If you click the hoe button at the bottom of the page it will bring ypu back to the login page.
i chose to impllemt the alogorithm in such a way that if another file were to be added it would be easy for the program to maintain standards 
The algorithm simply sorts through each row and each colums respectively searching for critea and using that criteria to increment certain counters ,using these counters you can the get a better understanfding of the maths behinnd the algorithm and succesfully produce an accurate probability
